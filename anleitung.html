            <p>Before you can start baking you should sift the flour, baking soda and cocoa so that you have that ready, otherwise you’re going to be stressed.</p>
            <img src="Image (15).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
            <p>Now you should melt 100 gr. butter in a saucepan until it’s completely melted. 
                <br>
                IMPORTANT: Don’t let it get chunky after you’ve melted it!</p>
                <img src="Image (16).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>While your butter is melting you should add your eggs, sugar and salt into a bowl and mix it with the mixer.</p>
                <img src="Image (17).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>You should mix all the previous ingredients so long until it get’s a little foamy. After you can continue with the rest. </p>
                <img src="Image (18).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>After you’ve mixed  it all you can add the flour mixture to the batter. The best way to add it is to mix the batter with the mixer while you add the flour mix. Like that you won’t end up having any little things in the batter.</p>
                <img src="Image (19).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>After you add the flour mix and mix it well it should look kind of like this. It has to be evenly mixed without any flour on walls of the bowl left.</p>
                <img src="Image (20).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>As soon as you mixed everything except for the butter you can turn the oven on. It should have the ventilation Program on and it has to be 160° as shown on the picture.</p>
                <img src="Image (21).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>Now it’s time to add the butter into the batter. The butter has to be completely melted.</p>
                <img src="Image (22).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>The batter should now be a little lighter and softer. From the flour the batter became thick and a bit difficult to mix, but now with the butter it should be softer.</p>
                <img src="Image (23).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>Now this step is optional. If you want to add some walnuts, you can go ahead and add them now. You should cut them into pieces or break them directly into the batter. I prefer cutting them :^ .</p>
                <img src="Image (24).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>Now the batter can look something like this. You should get a Spatula and gather all the rest that’s around the bowl’s wall’s.</p>
                <img src="Image (25).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>For this step you should take some parchment paper and cover the baking board in which you’re going to bake your Brownies. Something else what you can do to make your Brownies more special, is add some Nutella. Meaning you spread half the batter on the tin and then add Nutella on top. After you add the rest of the batter on top and then you’ll have Nutella in your Brownies. </p>
                <img src="Image (26).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>Now you put your tin in the Oven and you should turn on a timer for ca. 25 mins. It depends though. You should always keep an eye on it. It could take 15-20 mins, but it could also take 25-30 mins. After around ca. 10 mins it should look somewhat like this.</p>
                <img src="Image (27).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>As soon as it’s done baking leave it on the counter to cool down. And most importantly, DON’T take it out of the tin yet. Otherwise it’ll break apart. Leave it to rest for around 10 mins at least. After you can take it out.</p>
                <img src="Image (28).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>Now you can cut it into pieces and enjoy. If you added Nutella it should be visible on the inside when you cut it.</p>
                <img src="Image (29).jpg" alt="Ingredients">
                <p>You can put it onto a fancy plate to serve it to guests if you made it for them.

                    ENJOY :^ </p>
